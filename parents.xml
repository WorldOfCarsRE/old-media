		topic="What do I do if I'm trying to race but my Car won't move?"
		response="This could be a problem with the servers that run the game. The World of Cars needs regular maintenance and updates. We try to schedule these when the fewest Cars are online — usually late at night on the weekends. Cars that are online will always be notified that these short, but necessary, shutdowns are coming. Occasionally our servers get the hiccups, which can cause them to unexpectedly shut down. We do our best to keep that from happening and try to fix any problems quicker than Doc in his garage. Thank you for your patience!"
